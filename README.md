# Number-Baseball-Game

Number Baseball is a simple game that can be played by two people as a bet, and it is originally a game played with pen and paper.
Since there are only nine regular innings in baseball some people limit the number of guessing to nine.
Each person randomly selects three or four-digit, if you choose more or less it gets too hard or easy to solve.
The goal is to figure out what is the number of the opponent player.

Rules
1) The numbers used must be a different numbers from 0 to 9, Duplicate numbers are not used because the number of cases increases and makes it too hard to solve. In some cases, 0 is not used to make the game easier.
2)  If the number is not in the digit, Out. If the number is in the digit but the position is wrong, Ball. If the number is in the digit and the position is correct, Strike. Of course, you do not tell what number is Out or Ball or Strike, you only tell how many Out, Ball, Strike the opponent got.
