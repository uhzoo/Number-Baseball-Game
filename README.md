# Number-Baseball-Game

Number Baseball is a simple game that can be played by two people as a bet, and it is originally a game played with pen and paper.
Since there are only nine regular innings in baseball some people limit the number of guessing to nine.
Each person randomly selects a three or four digits number, if you choose more or less it gets too hard or easy to solve.
The goal is to figure out what number your opponent has selected.

Rules
1) The numbers used must be a different number from 0 to 9, Duplicate numbers are not used because the number of cases increases and makes it too hard to solve. In some cases, 0 is not used to make the game easier.
2) If the number guessed is a position in your opponents number, Strike. If the number guessed is in the number but not in the correct position, Ball. If the number guessed is not a position in your opponents number, Out. Of course, you do not tell what number is Out or Ball or Strike, you only tell how many Out, Ball, Strike the opponent got.

example)
number selected: [1 3 5]
guessed number: [1 2 3], 1 is Strike, 2 is Out, 3 is Ball. 1 Out 1 Ball 1 Strike.
guessed number: [5 3 1], 5 is Ball, 3 is Strike, 1 is Ball. 2 Ball 1 Strike.
guessed number: [9 8 7] Would be 3 Out.
